            Persian cats are one of the most popular domestic feline breeds. Did you know that the specimens we know today come 
            from the mixture of pure Persian and white Turkish angora? And that they have no hunting instinct?
            </p>
            
            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            Affectionate, conceited, aristocratic, lazy and very quiet, Persian cats are often described like this, one of the most 
            loved and admired domestic felines.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            Associated always with luxury and royalty, this minion proceeds as its name indicates from Persia (present-day Iran). 
            However, many of the specimens we see today are the result of crosses between the purebred Persian cat and the white Turkish angora. 
            Later, being considered a very valuable animal, it was interbred with other breeds of felines giving rise to multiple sub-races.
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            When choosing a Persian cat, you have to bear in mind that it is a pet that requires a lot of attention. It’s beautiful and 
            aristocratic fur needs to be cared for more than that of other feline races. It is recommended that the cat goes through the hands 
            of a feline stylist at least twice a year to preserve the condition of its hair.
            </p>

            <br/><br/><br/>

            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            Another requirement for having a feline of this breed is not to spend too much time away from home. Persians require more 
            companionship than other cats, so home-grown or elderly people who don’t go out much are the most recommended owners for these cats. 
            They don’t play much, they are more likely to lay on the couch than to chase a toy, so if you have kids, they won’t be too keen on 
            playing.

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            Persian cats do not move much, in fact since their creation they have been raised indoors (they has no instinct to go hunting and 
            some specimens suffer agoraphobia) so it is easy to become overweight. The way to prevent the cat from gaining weight and suffering 
            all the health problems associated with obesity is to ask the veterinarian for advice on the most suitable food for the cat as well 
            as the recommended food dosages.

            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            The original Persian cats arrived in Europe with two scholars: Pietro della Valle (1568 - 1652) and Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Pieresc 
            (1580 - 1637). The first, an Italian nobleman who travelled from Venice to India, passing through Turkey and Persia, was dazzled by 
            the first Persian cats. He acquired four pairs, sent them to Rome and arrived, according to what is believed, in 1621. Fabri de 
            Pieresc was a scientist who also surrendered to felines he considered "beautiful". The scientist brought angora cats from Turkey to 
            France.

            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            Persian cats as we know them today emerged in Britain in the 19th century as a result of the cross between the purebred Persian cat 
            from ancient Persia (now Iran) and the white Turkish angora. From this mixture was obtained a feline of softer fur and that could be 
            of more colours than the original.

            Persian cats may have polycystic kidney disease (PKD) that causes numerous cysts in the kidneys. These cysts can eventually
             lead to renal failure. Early diagnosis by the veterinarian will delay their evolution.
