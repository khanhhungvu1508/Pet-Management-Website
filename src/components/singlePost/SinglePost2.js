            We love our kitties and want them to be happy and well fed, but how do we even start to know what food is the best for them? 
            Is it simply the food they most enjoy? Or the foods that will help them be healthy and well-nourished. Our cats may have one 
            answer to that question but we know the right answer is what is best for their long-term health, and that starts with understanding
             what it is they actually do need, nutrition-wise.

            Cats are known to be obligate carnivores. That means that it is an absolute must for them to have meat in their diet, this is because
            they require certain nutrients that can only be found in animal meat. “Without nutrients such as taurine and arginine (found in meat 
            and fish) in their diets, your kitty could become extremely ill,” says Lucie Wilkins, a registered vet nurse and a cat blogger at Kitty 
            Cat Tree.

            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            What a cat needs nutrition wise will, much like with humans, change with their age and life situation. “As an experienced vet nurse, 
            I would always recommend life stage feeding for your cat,” says Wilkins. This means that the food they are eating should contain the
            different levels of protein, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and fat (the animal fat will ensure your cat has enough vitamin A) that
            they need for their development..     
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            For life stage feeding, says Wilkins, most cat foods are usually categorized into the following age groups:

            When choosing cat food for your beloved feline (unless they have specific dietary needs) it is important to choose
            a food that is listed as complete rather than complementary. “Complete food will include all that is required to keep 
            your cat happy and healthy,” says Wilkins.

            The ingredients that should be in your cat's food

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            So what ingredients should you be looking out for when searching for a quality balanced food for your cat?
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDescCap1"> 
            Protein

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            First off, a  named protein source. “A high quality cat food should be specific about which meat or fish the protein
            has come from rather than listed as ‘meat,” says Wilkins. You will want to be looking for listed ingredients such as
            ‘chicken heart’ for example.

            <p className="singlePostDescCap1"> 
            Carbohydrates
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            Cats do not need carbohydrates to thrive, however these are added to cat foods as “fillers”. “ They are needed in dry food
            to help combine and stick all the ingredients together ” , says Wilkins, who advises that foods which include fillers in wheat 
            or grain form to be avoided (cats are often allergic to these ingredients). It is best to find foods with listed ingredients 
            such as potato starch, sweet potatoes or peas.

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            Wilkins says an example of this would be something like chicken fat, turkey fat etc and in some premium foods you may also find 
            oils as a listed ingredient.

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            Many better quality cat food will have added vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C and Vitamin E, according to Wilkins.

            Make sure your cat has access to clean water
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            As well as finding food with the ingredients listed above, it is important that your cat always has access to 
            a clean source of water. "A question I often hear asked is if a cat should be given milk to drink,” says Wilkins.
             “Cats should never be given milk, most cats are lactose intolerant and milk can cause them severe tummy upset,” says Wilkins.
              As well as not agreeing with them, milk also contains sugar, which is unnecessary for your cat's diet and can result in your 
              kitty becoming unhealthily overweight.

            <p className="singlePostDescCap1"> 
            Do not share human food with your cat
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            Wilkins also advises that as cat parents, do not share your human food with your cat, there are a few reasons this is advised against: 
            “Some cats who are used to receiving alternative foods will then refuse their own, it unbalances the cats diet and will often cause them to gain weight,” 
            says Wilkins. Lastly, your cat may misbehave during your meal times, so that they are given food. 
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDescCap1"> 
            Do not put your cat on a vegetarian/vegan diet
            </p>

            <br/><br/>
            <p className="singlePostDesc1"> 
            Do not attempt to feed your cat a vegetarian or vegan diet,  warned Wilkins, your cat will become malnourished and unhealthy. It is important to always 
            put your cat's health first.
